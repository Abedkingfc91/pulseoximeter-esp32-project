# Pulse Oximeter ESP32 Project

A functional pulse oximeter system built using the ESP32 microcontroller and MAX30102 sensor. This project demonstrates real-time measurement of blood oxygen saturation (SpO‚ÇÇ) and heart rate (BPM), displayed on a 128x64 OLED screen. A second version simulates photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, enabling full signal processing pipeline testing without hardware.

## Why This Project Matters

Designed as a showcase of self-taught applied engineering in MedTech, this project reflects my ability to:
- Translate medical sensing theory into working embedded systems
- Apply signal processing techniques to extract physiological metrics
- Work across hardware, firmware, and algorithm development
- Communicate results clearly via UI (OLED) and documentation

As a incoming graduate student in Human Systems Engineering concentraing in Health Sysems with a background in Health Technology, this hands-on build sharpens my technical credibility while reinforcing my user-centric design foundation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works ‚Äì Step-by-Step

### 1. **Signal Acquisition**
- **Hardware Mode**: The MAX30102 emits IR and Red light into tissue and captures reflected light to generate raw PPG signals.
- **Simulated Mode**: Gaussian pulses simulate systolic/diastolic peaks + noise to mimic real PPG waveforms.

### 2. **Filtering**
- **High-Pass Filter** removes baseline wander (DC drift).
- **Low-Pass Filter** smooths high-frequency noise and stabilizes AC signals.

### 3. **AC/DC Extraction**
- AC component = pulsatile flow (from heartbeat)
- DC component = constant light absorption by tissue
- Calculated for both IR and Red signals over a circular buffer.

### 4. **SpO‚ÇÇ Calculation**
Formula used: R = (AC_Red / DC_Red) √∑ (AC_IR / DC_IR)
SpO‚ÇÇ = 110 - 25 √ó R

This ratio-of-ratios method approximates blood oxygen saturation.

### 5. **Heart Rate Detection**
- Peaks in the IR waveform are detected using amplitude thresholds.
- Time between peaks determines BPM:  
  `BPM = 60 / (time between peaks)`

### 6. **Display Output**
- Values are shown on the OLED in real-time.
- Simulated mode outputs signals to Serial Plotter.
